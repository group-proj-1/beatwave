# beatwave

## Description

beatwave is a unique application that allows a user to generate a Spotify playlist based on the current weather in any city in the world.

This project is powered by the Spotify and OpenWeather APIs.

## Installation

When the user loads the page, they are presented with a playlist based on the current weather in Chicago, where this application was designed with love. The user can enter any city name in the search field, and beatwave will find a Spotify playlist inspired by its weather. The current weather conditions and temperature displays on the screen and a seven-day forecast is generated as well.
